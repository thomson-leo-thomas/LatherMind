# LatherMind - AI Soap Analysis Application

LatherMind is a React web application that combines Machine Learning (TensorFlow.js) and Computer Vision (OpenCV.js) to analyze soap images and generate a "Soapliness Indexâ„¢" score. The application classifies soap types, performs image analysis, and produces downloadable certificates with funny nicknames and detailed scoring breakdowns.

## Features

- **Image Upload & Camera Support**: Upload soap images or use device camera
- **ML Classification**: TensorFlow.js-powered classification into 3 soap categories:
  - ðŸ§¼ Brick of Purity (Bar Soap)
  - ðŸ§´ Potion of Cleanliness (Liquid Soap)  
  - ðŸ§½ Soap DoppelgÃ¤nger (Not Soap)
- **Computer Vision Analysis**: OpenCV.js processes images for:
  - Color histogram analysis
  - Edge detection (Canny algorithm)
  - Contour analysis for shape evaluation
  - Laplacian variance for sharpness assessment
- **Soapliness Indexâ„¢ Scoring**: Combines ML and CV metrics for 0-100 score
- **Certificate Generation**: Downloadable PNG certificates with humor nicknames
- **WhatsApp Sharing**: Share results on social media

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js, Teachable Machine integration
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV.js
- **Certificate Generation**: html2canvas
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL support

## Getting Started

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI:
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard if needed

### GitHub Deployment

The project is ready for GitHub Pages or other static hosting:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `dist` folder to your hosting service

## Development

### Adding New Soap Classifications

1. Update `SOAP_CLASSES` in `client/src/lib/scoring.ts`
2. Modify the scoring algorithm as needed
3. Update TypeScript types in `client/src/types/soap-analysis.ts`

### Customizing Analysis

- **TensorFlow Model**: Update the model URL in `client/src/lib/tensorflow.ts`
- **OpenCV Processing**: Modify image processing in `client/src/lib/opencv.ts`
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Adjust weights in `client/src/lib/scoring.ts`
