# LatherMind - AI Soap Analysis Application 🎯


## Basic Details


### Members
- Thomson Leo Thomas - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
LatherMind is the world’s first AI-powered soap evaluation platform — yes, we rate soap. 🧼🚀
Classifies bar or liquid, then uses machine learning + OpenCV to analyze colour, shape, and sharpness, delivering a Soapliness Score with an official frame-worthy certificate— perfect for shamelessly flexing to friends, rivals, and random strangers online.

Because hygiene deserved its own moon landing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist )
We’ve mastered space travel.
We’ve mapped the human genome.
We can 3D-print organs.

And yet…
Humanity still has no precise, scientific way to know if a bar of soap or bottle of hand wash is truly living up to its potential.

This isn’t just a gap in hygiene.
It’s a gap in human progress -and in our deep, primal urge to flex. Because if there’s one thing humans love more than staying clean, it’s showing off how clean their soap game is

### The Solution that nobody asked for(But You’ll Brag About Anyway)
We pointed cutting-edge tech at… soap.
Because why not?

Here’s the mission plan:

1. Snap a pic — bar 🧼 or liquid 🧴, no judgment.


2. Machine Learning model swoops in to classify your soap type like it’s identifying rare wildlife.


3. OpenCV magic runs colour calibration (because “Lemon Fresh” ≠ random yellow blob).


4. Shape geometry analysis checks if your soap is a sleek oval or a rebellious rectangle.


5. Sharpness detection ensures your soap looks HD enough for a shampoo commercial.


6. Crunches all that into next-level calculations to spit out your Soapliness Score.



The grand finale?
A share-worthy, flex-worthy, frame-it-on-your-wall-worthy certificate proving your soap is objectively legendary — and making every other bathroom jealous.

🧪 Image Processing Pipeline
LatherMind performs comprehensive image analysis through four main components:

Original Image: User-uploaded soap image
Binary Mask: Thresholded shape analysis using OpenCV
Canny Edges: Edge detection for outline quality assessment
Color Histogram: HSV/RGB color distribution analysis

🏆 Soapliness Index™ Scoring
The scoring algorithm evaluates:

Classification Confidence (40%) - ML model certainty
Color Quality (25%) - Dominant color assessment
Shape Analysis (20%) - Edge clarity and contour smoothness
Image Sharpness (15%) - Laplacian variance calculation

How LatherMind Works (Step by Step)

From the video/demo flow, here’s what’s happening when someone uses LatherMind:

1. User Chooses an Input

They either upload a soap image or use the live camera.

The app instantly displays the original photo in the Live Preview Panel.



2. ML Classification (Teachable Machine + TensorFlow.js)

The image is sent to a pre-trained ML model (hosted right in the browser).

The model predicts one of three classes:
🧼 Brick of Purity (Bar Soap)
🧴 Potion of Cleanliness (Liquid Soap)
🧽 Soap Doppelgänger (Not Soap)

A confidence graph shows the probability of each result.



3. OpenCV.js Image Processing

The same image is analyzed for visual metrics:

Color Histogram → Determines the dominant colors and matches them to the Color Interpretation Table.

Canny Edge Detection → Finds the soap’s edges to check shape precision.

Contour Analysis → Rates the smoothness of the soap’s outline.

Laplacian Variance → Measures image sharpness (blurry vs. crisp).




4. Soapliness Index™ Calculation

Each analysis result contributes points:

finalScore = classScore + colorScore + shapeScore + sharpnessScore;

The total is your Soapliness Score (0–100).



5. Results Display

Breakdown table shows exactly how each factor scored.

Processed image views (Binary Mask, Edges, Histogram) are shown side-by-side.

A PNG certificate is generated (via HTML2Canvas) so you can brag about your soap’s glory on WhatsApp or anywhere else.

How Teachable Machine Works in LatherMind

Teachable Machine is Google’s no-code tool for training machine learning models. In your project, it’s the “brain” that figures out what kind of soap it’s looking at.

How it works in general:

1. Image Collection & Labeling – You feed Teachable Machine example images, grouped into categories (called “classes”).


2. Model Training – Behind the scenes, it uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the visual patterns that separate each class.


3. Export – Once trained, you can export the model for web use (model.json + metadata.json + weights.bin).





How you used it in LatherMind:

1. Created 3 Classes:

🧼 Brick of Purity — bar soap

🧴 Potion of Cleanliness — liquid soap

🧽 Soap Doppelgänger — not soap (to catch imposters)



2. Trained the Model:

Uploaded multiple images for each class to Teachable Machine.

Made sure to include different angles, lighting, and backgrounds so the model could recognise soap in various real-world conditions.



3. Exported for Web:

Downloaded the TensorFlow.js model files (model.json, metadata.json, weights.bin).



4. Integrated into LatherMind:

Loaded the model in-browser with TensorFlow.js.

When the user uploads or streams an image, the model runs inference in real time.

It outputs probabilities for each class, which are displayed in your Confidence Graph.



5. Feeds Into Scoring:

The predicted class gives a Class Score, which is combined with OpenCV’s colour, shape, and sharpness analysis to produce the final Soapliness Index™.

🧠 What I Learned

Building LatherMind taught me how to blend AI, computer vision, and front-end development into a single, interactive web app. I learned how to train a custom Teachable Machine model, export it for TensorFlow.js. I also dove deep into OpenCV.js, using techniques like colour histograms, contour detection, and Laplacian variance to turn pixels into measurable soap metrics. On the UI side, I got comfortable integrating live camera feeds, visualising data in confidence graphs, and generating shareable PNG certificates.


🚀 What’s Next

LatherMind is just warming up. Next, I’d supercharge it with a beefier dataset for razor-sharp accuracy, add AR overlays for live, in-your-face scoring, and launch a global Soapliness Leaderboard so you can finally prove your soap is superior — and rub it in your friends’ faces. Oh, and every rating comes with a flex-worthy, shareable certificate, because what’s the point of science if you can’t brag about it?

💡 Why It Matters

This project proved I can take a ridiculous idea and engineer it into something polished, playful, and unforgettable — blending real AI chops with unapologetic creativity. It’s not just a product; it’s a conversation starter, a smile generator, and a reminder that innovation doesn’t have to be boring.

Because if we can rate soap and hand wash, we can rate anything — and let’s be honest, humans love to flex. This is just the beginning. 🧼🚀
