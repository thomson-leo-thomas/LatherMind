# LatherMind - AI Soap Analysis Application üéØ


## Basic Details


### Members
- Thomson Leo Thomas - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
LatherMind is the world‚Äôs first AI-powered soap evaluation platform ‚Äî yes, we rate soap. üßºüöÄ
Classifies bar or liquid, then uses machine learning + OpenCV to analyze colour, shape, and sharpness, delivering a Soapliness Score with an official certificate.
Because hygiene deserved its own moon landing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist )
We‚Äôve mastered space travel.
We‚Äôve mapped the human genome.
We can 3D-print organs.

And yet‚Ä¶
Humanity still has no precise, scientific way to know if a bar of soap or bottle of hand wash is truly living up to its potential.

This isn‚Äôt just a gap in hygiene.
It‚Äôs a gap in human progress.

### The Solution that nobody asked for(But You‚Äôll Brag About Anyway)
We pointed cutting-edge tech at‚Ä¶ soap.
Because why not?

Here‚Äôs the mission plan:

1. Snap a pic ‚Äî bar üßº or liquid üß¥, no judgment.


2. Machine Learning model swoops in to classify your soap type like it‚Äôs identifying rare wildlife.


3. OpenCV magic runs colour calibration (because ‚ÄúLemon Fresh‚Äù ‚â† random yellow blob).


4. Shape geometry analysis checks if your soap is a sleek oval or a rebellious rectangle.


5. Sharpness detection ensures your soap looks HD enough for a shampoo commercial.


6. Crunches all that into next-level calculations to spit out your Soapliness Score.



End result?
A certificate proving your soap is objectively legendary.

### Implementation
Installation
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
npm install
Start development server
npm run dev
Open your browser Navigate to http://localhost:5000


üß™ Image Processing Pipeline
LatherMind performs comprehensive image analysis through four main components:

Original Image: User-uploaded soap image
Binary Mask: Thresholded shape analysis using OpenCV
Canny Edges: Edge detection for outline quality assessment
Color Histogram: HSV/RGB color distribution analysis

üèÜ Soapliness Index‚Ñ¢ Scoring
The scoring algorithm evaluates:

Classification Confidence (40%) - ML model certainty
Color Quality (25%) - Dominant color assessment
Shape Analysis (20%) - Edge clarity and contour smoothness
Image Sharpness (15%) - Laplacian variance calculation

How LatherMind Works (Step by Step)

From the video/demo flow, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening when someone uses LatherMind:

1. User Chooses an Input

They either upload a soap image or use the live camera.

The app instantly displays the original photo in the Live Preview Panel.



2. ML Classification (Teachable Machine + TensorFlow.js)

The image is sent to a pre-trained ML model (hosted right in the browser).

The model predicts one of three classes:
üßº Brick of Purity (Bar Soap)
üß¥ Potion of Cleanliness (Liquid Soap)
üßΩ Soap Doppelg√§nger (Not Soap)

A confidence graph shows the probability of each result.



3. OpenCV.js Image Processing

The same image is analyzed for visual metrics:

Color Histogram ‚Üí Determines the dominant colors and matches them to the Color Interpretation Table.

Canny Edge Detection ‚Üí Finds the soap‚Äôs edges to check shape precision.

Contour Analysis ‚Üí Rates the smoothness of the soap‚Äôs outline.

Laplacian Variance ‚Üí Measures image sharpness (blurry vs. crisp).




4. Soapliness Index‚Ñ¢ Calculation

Each analysis result contributes points:

finalScore = classScore + colorScore + shapeScore + sharpnessScore;

The total is your Soapliness Score (0‚Äì100).



5. Results Display

Breakdown table shows exactly how each factor scored.

Processed image views (Binary Mask, Edges, Histogram) are shown side-by-side.

A PNG certificate is generated (via HTML2Canvas) so you can brag about your soap‚Äôs glory on WhatsApp or anywhere else.

How Teachable Machine Works in LatherMind

Teachable Machine is Google‚Äôs no-code tool for training machine learning models. In your project, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù that figures out what kind of soap it‚Äôs looking at.

How it works in general:

1. Image Collection & Labeling ‚Äì You feed Teachable Machine example images, grouped into categories (called ‚Äúclasses‚Äù).


2. Model Training ‚Äì Behind the scenes, it uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the visual patterns that separate each class.


3. Export ‚Äì Once trained, you can export the model for web use (model.json + metadata.json + weights.bin).





How you used it in LatherMind:

1. Created 3 Classes:

üßº Brick of Purity ‚Äî bar soap

üß¥ Potion of Cleanliness ‚Äî liquid soap

üßΩ Soap Doppelg√§nger ‚Äî not soap (to catch imposters)



2. Trained the Model:

Uploaded multiple images for each class to Teachable Machine.

Made sure to include different angles, lighting, and backgrounds so the model could recognise soap in various real-world conditions.



3. Exported for Web:

Downloaded the TensorFlow.js model files (model.json, metadata.json, weights.bin).



4. Integrated into LatherMind:

Loaded the model in-browser with TensorFlow.js.

When the user uploads or streams an image, the model runs inference in real time.

It outputs probabilities for each class, which are displayed in your Confidence Graph.



5. Feeds Into Scoring:

The predicted class gives a Class Score, which is combined with OpenCV‚Äôs colour, shape, and sharpness analysis to produce the final Soapliness Index‚Ñ¢.

## üêõ Known Issues

- OpenCV.js model loading may show warnings in console (normal behavior)
- Large images may take longer to process
- Some edge cases in color detection for transparent soaps
