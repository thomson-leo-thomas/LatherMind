# LatherMind - AI Soap Analysis Application üéØ


## Basic Details


### Members
- Thomson Leo Thomas - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
LatherMind is the world‚Äôs first AI-powered soap evaluation platform ‚Äî yes, we rate soap. üßºüöÄ
Classifies bar or liquid, then uses machine learning + OpenCV to analyze colour, shape, and sharpness, delivering a Soapliness Score with an official certificate.
Because hygiene deserved its own moon landing.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist )
We‚Äôve mastered space travel.
We‚Äôve mapped the human genome.
We can 3D-print organs.

And yet‚Ä¶
Humanity still has no precise, scientific way to know if a bar of soap or bottle of hand wash is truly living up to its potential.

This isn‚Äôt just a gap in hygiene.
It‚Äôs a gap in human progress.

### The Solution that nobody asked for(But You‚Äôll Brag About Anyway)
We pointed cutting-edge tech at‚Ä¶ soap.
Because why not?

Here‚Äôs the mission plan:

1. Snap a pic ‚Äî bar üßº or liquid üß¥, no judgment.


2. Machine Learning model swoops in to classify your soap type like it‚Äôs identifying rare wildlife.


3. OpenCV magic runs colour calibration (because ‚ÄúLemon Fresh‚Äù ‚â† random yellow blob).


4. Shape geometry analysis checks if your soap is a sleek oval or a rebellious rectangle.


5. Sharpness detection ensures your soap looks HD enough for a shampoo commercial.


6. Crunches all that into next-level calculations to spit out your Soapliness Score.



End result?
A certificate proving your soap is objectively legendary.

## üßº Features

  **AI-Powered Soap Classification**: Uses TensorFlow.js with Teachable Machine models to identify soap types
  **Advanced Image Processing**: OpenCV.js integration for color analysis, edge detection, and shape assessment
  **Real-time Analysis**: Browser-based processing for instant results
  **4-Column Image Processing Panel**: Original Image, Binary Mask, Canny Edges, and Color Histogram visualization
  **Downloadable Certificates**: Generate shareable PNG certificates with scoring details
  **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

### Implementation
 Installation
Clone the repository
Install dependencies
npm install
Start development server
npm run dev
Open your browser Navigate to http://localhost:5000


üß™ Image Processing Pipeline
LatherMind performs comprehensive image analysis through four main components:

Original Image: User-uploaded soap image
Binary Mask: Thresholded shape analysis using OpenCV
Canny Edges: Edge detection for outline quality assessment
Color Histogram: HSV/RGB color distribution analysis

üèÜ Soapliness Index‚Ñ¢ Scoring
The scoring algorithm evaluates:

Classification Confidence (40%) - ML model certainty
Color Quality (25%) - Dominant color assessment
Shape Analysis (20%) - Edge clarity and contour smoothness
Image Sharpness (15%) - Laplacian variance calculation
