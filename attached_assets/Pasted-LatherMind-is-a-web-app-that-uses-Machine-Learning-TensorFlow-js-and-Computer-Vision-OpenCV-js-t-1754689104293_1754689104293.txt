LatherMind is a web app that uses Machine Learning (TensorFlow.js) and Computer Vision (OpenCV.js) to classify soap types, analyze their geometry, and calculate a Soapliness Index™ from an uploaded image or live camera feed.
It’s a fun blend of AI + image processing with a clean, playful UI.

🔗 How ML & OpenCV Work Together in This Project
ML (Teachable Machine Model + TensorFlow.js)

You will upload your metadata.json, model.json, and weights from Teachable Machine.

TensorFlow.js loads this model directly in the browser.

Given an image, the model predicts one of three classes:

🧼 Brick of Purity – Bar Soap

🧴 Potion of Cleanliness – Liquid Soap

🧽 Soap Doppelgänger – Not Soap

It outputs probabilities for each class, which we display in a Confidence Graph.

OpenCV.js (Computer Vision Analysis)

Once the image is classified, OpenCV processes it to extract measurable visual data:

Color Histogram → Maps the dominant colors to our Color Interpretation Table.

Canny Edge Detection → Evaluates the shape's cleanliness and symmetry.

Contour Analysis → Determines smoothness or irregularity.

Laplacian Variance → Measures sharpness/blur level.

Each metric contributes points to the Soapliness Index™.

Data Connection

ML gives the what (class of soap).

OpenCV gives the how it looks (color, shape, sharpness).

Both feed into a scoring algorithm that:

finalScore = classScore + colorScore + shapeScore + sharpnessScore;
The result is displayed instantly along with:
